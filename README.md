Determines where a user is going to navigate to next on a website

When making repeat visits to a website, many users tend to follow similar paths through the website's pages. If we can observe where a user has been, we can make a good guess at where they will go next. The logic behind these predictions is deterministic and based entirely on how the user has been observed to behave in the past. As such, the predictions made are probabilistic, tentative and subject to continued revision. Predictions will be improved if your users do not experience too much free will!
